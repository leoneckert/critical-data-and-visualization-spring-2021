## Data Story & Data Story Contextual Report

### Overview

In data, we can find stories. In this project you will tell one of them.

The first step is to **identify one or several datasets** you want to work with. Next, you need to get **deeply familiar with the context of it**; you need to know, for example, what it is about, and what it is not about, who created it, and why it is accessible to you. You also need to have a hunch about what it is that you intend to show, is there a a literal story in the data? A “thread" that you can color “red” through visualization? Or is there a contrast you aim to highlight, a juxtaposition of two perspectives? The research and the ideas you develop will be the central element of you Contextual Report & Presentation, a milestone that will be treated as a project in itself.

The second part requires your visual design and code proficiency: A website that tells a story that emerges from and is told alongside a dataset (or several).

### The Data

The dataset(s) you choose is the foundation for this project. You can find datasets that exist already online, or create your own one by collecting data manually or scraping it from the web (I can advise). It is most important that you take time for the process of deciding on a dataset.

Some advice: you will be working with this dataset (and related subject matter) for almost 7 weeks - pick something that you don’t get bored of. Your data story is NOT expected to make a discovery and reveal something never seen or suspected before - what matters is your passion for the subject as well as the potential for creative visualizations of it.

### The Data Story Contextual Report & Presentation (Week 10)

The Data Story Contextual Report is a short piece of writing. It should contain 500-700 words and address questions laid out in [this structure](../contextual-report-guide). The structure is a guide, but not every point might apply to your research; try not to stick to it mechanically, but express yourself in your own style instead. Your text should be concise and well-articulated. Please ask at least one friend to proof-read it before you hand it in.

Along with your writing, you are expected to present your research in a 5 minute presentation - the structure of the presentation should be oriented by your writing and use slides to support (but not echo) your words.

**Both (writing and presentation) are due on April 12th.**

**Submit** your writing to this [Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YH60YvPJahddMmV_nOsb2LzMEEuAfdR1?usp=sharing) and your presentation slides to [this one](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fy64fHgyM5LeRjuHquLZ7CDswVSNhvTM?usp=sharing). Add a links to both to the [Class Wiki](https://github.com/leoneckert/critical-data-and-visualization-spring-2021/wiki).


### The Data Story (Week 14)

The Data Story is a webpage that includes at least two interactive data visualizations as well as contextual information (mainly taken from your Contextual Report). More detailed instructions for this will be shared with you after the Contextual Report is completed.

**This is due on May 10th.**


#### Delivery

- Presentation (Due **May 10th**)
- README.md (Due **May 12th**)
- Submission Form for IMA Show (and CDV Archive) (Due **May 12th**)

Details:

##### Presentation (Due **May 10th**)

- Prepare a 4-6 minute presentation of your project. Be prepared to share your screen (and sound if necessary) and demo your website while explaining it to the audience.
  - assume the audience has never seen your project (guest critics won't have)
  - don't assume that anyone reads large passages of text during your presentation - explain/summarize what we need to know
  - talk about your process, compromises you made, aspects you are most proud of as well those that didn't turn out the way you intended.
  - Add links to code, page and presentation slides to the [Class Wiki](https://github.com/leoneckert/critical-data-and-visualization-spring-2021/wiki).

##### README.md (Due **May 12th**)

When you push your project to GitHub, include a `README.md`. Include two sections:

```
## The Project
 - The project's name
 - A link to the live version of the project
 - An animated GIF of your favorite detail of the visualization
  - don't try to include every aspect of your project in one GIF, just **a small aspect that you think looks good** and will make people want to visit it (something that moves, e.g. a transition)
 - 2-3 sentences about the project
  - written in a style that will make people want to visit it
 - links to the source of the data you used
  - if you compiled the data yourself, describe your methodology

## The Process

- Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?
- What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?
- Did you make crucial compromises? Which ones?
- If you had more time, what would you change, improve, add to the project?
```


##### Submission Form for IMA Show (and CDV Archive) (Due **May 12th**)

- [Submit your project to this Form](https://forms.gle/17rsRSoSQ5W9CDse8)
  - The info asked for in the form is the same as in the first section of your README.md. You may copy and paste this.
